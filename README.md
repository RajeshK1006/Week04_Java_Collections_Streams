## Overview

In Week 4, we delve into advanced Java features, including:

- **Generics**: Writing type-safe, reusable code.  
- **Collections Framework**: Lists, Sets, Maps, and their implementations.  
- **I/O Streams**: Reading/writing data efficiently.  
- **Exception Handling**: Robust error management.  
- **Regex & Unit Testing**: Pattern matching and testing fundamentals.  
- **Java 8 Features**: Lambdas, Streams, and functional programming paradigms.

## Topics Covered

### 01_JavaGenerics
- Introduction to Generics and type parameters
- Generic classes, methods, and interfaces
- Bounded type parameters and wildcards (`?`, `T`, `K`, `V`)
- Type erasure and limitations

### 02_Collections
- Core Interfaces: `List`, `Set`, `Queue`, `Map`
- Implementations:
  - `ArrayList` vs `LinkedList`
  - `HashSet`, `TreeSet`, `LinkedHashSet`
  - `HashMap`, `TreeMap`, `LinkedHashMap`
- Utility methods in the `Collections` class (sorting, shuffling, etc.)

### 03_JavaIOStreams
- Byte Streams: `InputStream`, `OutputStream`
- Character Streams: `Reader`, `Writer`
- Buffered Streams and serialization
- Working with Files and Paths using NIO

### 04_Exceptions
- Checked vs Unchecked exceptions
- `try-catch-finally` blocks
- Creating custom exceptions and best practices

### 05_Regex & Unit Testing
- Regex with `java.util.regex` for pattern matching
- Unit Testing:
  - Basics of JUnit
  - `@Test` annotation
  - Common assertions

### 06_Java8Features
- Lambda Expressions: Functional programming syntax
- Stream API: `filter`, `map`, `reduce`, `collect`
- `Optional` class and enhanced `DateTime` API

## Prerequisites

- Java installed and set up with JDK (version 8 or later recommended)  
- Familiarity with Java basics (classes, interfaces, methods)  
- A Java IDE like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or a text editor with terminal access
